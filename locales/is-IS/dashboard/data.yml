        maze_2_14: 'Ok, this is just like the last puzzle, but you need to remember how you used the "if" block and the "repeat" block together.'
        maze_2_15: "Ég vilja sólblóm! Notaðu „ef“ einingu til að koma mér þangað með sem fæstum einingum."

          Draw a triangle whose sides are all in different colors, using the "random color" option that picks a different color each time. Hint: you'll have to figure out how far to turn by clicking on the number in the turn block.
        turtle_1_5: "Now, for practice, draw a triangle and then a square to draw an envelope."
        turtle_1_6: "Can you figure out how draw this triangle and square? Hint: Do the triangle first, then figure out how much to turn before drawing the square."
        turtle_1_7: "Ok, let's make it a bit harder - see if you can draw these green glasses. The squares are 100 pixels on each side, and they're 50 pixels apart. Don't forget to draw in green!"
        turtle_1_8: 'Ok, try to figure out what happens if you run this code (or press "Run" to try it). Then, repeat it enough times to complete the drawing. The colors will be different every time.'
        turtle_1_9: "Can you figure out what number to replace the question marks with to draw a circle?"
        turtle_1_10: 'You made it! Now, draw anything you want. Some fun ideas: a stick figure, snowflake, or spiral. Also try the new "set width" block. Have fun!'
        turtle_4_1: 'Can you draw a triangle (with edges of 100 pixels) with only 3 blocks? Hint: use a "repeat" block.'
        turtle_4_2: |-
          Try adding one block to complete this puzzle. Hint: we've provided blocks to draw 2 identical triangles, you need to put a "turn" in between, and decide out how far to turn.
        turtle_4_3: |-
          Ok, here's the code you wrote to draw a single triangle. Can you add a "repeat" and "turn" block to make a pretty flower?
        turtle_4_4: "Here's the same code from the previous puzzle, but turning only 36 degrees after drawing each triangle. How many times does this need to repeat? (Hint: after 360 degrees of turning the drawing will come full circle)"
        turtle_4_5: "Here's the same code from the previous puzzle, but repeating the turns 36 times. How many degrees should the turns be? (Hint: after 360 degrees of turning the drawing will come full circle)"
        turtle_4_6: "Using only 3 blocks, can you draw a square with edges of 20 pixels?"
        turtle_4_7: "Here's the code for drawing the square from last puzzle. Can you repeat it to draw 10 adjacent squares like a ladder? Hint: you only need 2 more blocks."
        turtle_4_8: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. Can you add just 2 more blocks to complete the drawing?"
        turtle_4_9: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. How many degrees should you turn to complete the drawing? (You probably need to guess a few times)"
        turtle_4_10: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. How many times should you repeat to complete the drawing?"
        turtle_4_11: 'Try changing the numbers in the "turn" and "repeat" blocks to make different patterns. Or, experiment changing the rest of the code to draw anything you want.'

          Hi, I'm a farmer. I need your help to flatten the field on my farm so it's ready for planting. Move me to the pile of dirt and use the "remove" block to remove it.
        maze_karel_1_2: 'Next, move me to the hole and fill it with TWO shovelfuls of dirt, using the "fill" block.'
        maze_karel_1_3: "Move me to the pile of dirt and tell me how many shovelfuls to remove using as few blocks as possible."
        maze_karel_1_4: "Can you help me remove all four piles of dirt? Hint: use a repeat block if you can."
        maze_karel_1_5: 'Help me fill in all these holes with 5 shovelfuls of dirt. Hint: you can put a "repeat" block inside the "while" block.'
        maze_karel_1_6: |-
          Remove all the piles of dirt, using as few blocks as possible. The new options in the dropdown menu on the "while" block tell me if I'm standing on a pile or a hole.
        maze_karel_1_7: "Wow, I found a really deep hole! I don't know how many shovelfuls of dirt it needs. Can you write a program that fills it until the ground is even?"
        maze_karel_1_8: "Help me fill in the hole at the end of the field, using as few blocks as possible."
        maze_karel_1_9: 'Make me remove all these piles of dirt. Try to use as few blocks as possible. Hint: try using a "while" block.'
        maze_karel_1_10: "I'm working late, so it's dark out, and I can't tell how large the piles are. Now I don't have all the options I used to have on the while block. Move me along the field, and if there is a pile, remove it."
        maze_karel_1_11: |-
          It's still dark outside. Move me along the field. If there is a pile, remove it, and if there is a hole, fill it in. Hint: use the dropdown menu of options on the "if" block.
        turtle_2_1: "Halló. Ég uppvakningslistamaður. Ég elska teikna! Hjálpaðu mér að teikna ferning í ákveðnum lit. Mikilvægt athugasemd: þú ert með sömu einingar og áður en þeim hefur verið skipt í flokka."
        turtle_2_2: "Velkomin/-n í notkun falla sem leyfa þér að skilgreina nýjar einingar! Prófaðu nýja „draga ferning“ einingu sem finna má undir flokknum „Föll“ til að teikna lítinn 50x50 grænan ferning."
        turtle_2_3: 'Use the "repeat" block (in the "Loops" category) to draw 3 squares of size 100, each 120 degrees apart. And do it in 3 different, random colors.'
        turtle_2_4: "Now we're going to get fancy. Change the code to draw 36 squares, 100 pixels wide, and each 10 degrees apart. Hint: you may want to use the slider to make me go faster."
        turtle_2_5: |-
          Draw squares with sides of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 pixels.  You'll need to use the "draw a square" function five times.
        turtle_2_6: |-
          Ok, this program will use a counter, to draw the same squares as last time. You want the square to be the same size as the counter, so use the "counter" block. Hint: It's in the Variables category.
        turtle_2_7: |-
          Here's a program to draw a spiral, but the blocks are disabled so they won't run. Make a new program using a "count with" block (in the Loops category) and "counter" block (in the Variables category) to draw the same spiral.
        turtle_2_7_5: |-
          There's a new "draw a snowman" function (in the Functions category). Draw two snowmen, of height 250 and 100.
        turtle_2_8: |-
          This one's a bit tricky. Use the "draw a snowman" function and the new "jump forward" block (in the Actions category). Draw 3 snowmen in different colors, 100 pixels apart.
        turtle_2_9: 'Use a "count with" loop to draw a family of snowmen with heights of 110, 100, 90, 80, and 70. The snowmen should all be 60 pixels apart.'
        turtle_2_10: "Here's some code to try experimenting with different spirals.  What happens if you change the turn amount? Or set a random color in the loop?  Draw anything you like."
        maze_karel_2_1: "Try using the blocks to help me remove all the piles and fill in all the holes on the ground. Try to use loops instead of using too many blocks. Hint: you can put a loop inside another loop."
        maze_karel_2_2: |-
          We've defined our own block called "fill 5", which is now in the Functions category. Use it to help me fill in this hole.
        maze_karel_2_3: |-
          Use the new "fill 5" function block to make me fill in all the holes. You'll have to drag out the "fill 5" block out from the Functions category.
        maze_karel_2_4: "Define a new function that removes 7 shovelfuls. Then use it to write a program that helps me remove all the piles."
        maze_karel_2_5: "Create a new function that removes 6 shovelfuls from a pile, and use it to help me level out all the piles."
        maze_karel_2_6: "Notaðu tvö ný föll, „fylla 8“ og „fjarlægja 8“, til að hjálpa mér að jafna út staflann og fylla upp í holuna."
        maze_karel_2_7: "Það er kýr á túninu mínu! Skrifaðu nýtt fall sem hjálpar mér að forðast kúnna og fjarlægja staflann. Settu allar einingarnar inn í nýja fallið."
        maze_karel_2_8: "Notaðu þetta nýja fall, „forðast kúnna og fjarlægja 1“, til að hjálpa mér að fjarlægja allan staflann."
        maze_karel_2_9: "Ok, hér er fall sem fjarlægjir 4 mismunandi stafla af skít í lóðréttum reit. Reyndu að setja þetta fall inn í lykkju svo að þú getir fjarlægt alla skítastaflana með því að nota aðeins fáar nýjar einingar."
        maze_karel_2_10: "Færðu mig yfir túnið og notaðu þessi tvö föll til að hjálpa mér að fjarlægja alla staflana og fylla upp í allar holurnar."
        turtle_3_1: "Þetta verkefni sýnir þér hvernig „teikna ferning“ og „teikna hring“ föllin eru skilgreind. Skilgreining á falli keyrir ekki einingarnar. Þú verður að draga „teikna ferning“ eininguna út til að teikna ferning."
        turtle_3_2: "Með því að nota „teikna ferning“ fallið sem dæmi, búðu til fallið „teikna þríhyrning“ og notaðu það."
        turtle_3_3: "Dragðu þríhyrndar girðingar í kringum kettina og ferhyrndar girðingar í kringum kýrnar. Ráðlegging: prófaðu forritið á meðan þú vinnur í því."
        turtle_3_4: "Athugaðu hvort þú getur fundið út úr því hvernig þú átt að nota „teikna ferning“ og „teikna þríhyrning“ (og nokkrar aðrar einingar) til að teikna hús utanum ljónið."
        turtle_3_5: "Búðu núna til fallið „teikna hús“ og notaðu það til að hýsa tvo ketti. Vísbending: búðu til nýtt fall með því að nota eininguna „gera eitthvað“ og skrifaðu þinn eiginn texta til að nefna eininguna."
        turtle_3_6: 'Using "draw a square" as an example, add an input named "length" to "draw a triangle". Then, draw triangles in different sizes. (Hint: click the star to add an input to a function)'

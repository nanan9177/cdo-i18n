        text: "We'll be using Blockly, a visual programming language where you drag and drop blocks to write code."
      3:
        image: "notes/hoc1_3.jpg"
        text: 'Most code is typed, but Blockly is visual. Each blocks corresponds to a line of "real" code.'

        text: "The goal of your first program is to get an Angry Bird through a maze to hit a Green Pig."
      7:
        image: "notes/hoc1_7.jpg"
        text: "The left side is the maze where your program is run. The instructions for each puzzle are below the maze."
      8:
        image: "notes/hoc1_8.jpg"
        text: "The middle toolbox has the commands for the Angry Bird. You'll use these to build your code."
      9:
        image: "notes/hoc1_9.jpg"
        text: "On the right is your workspace where you'll drag blocks from the toolbox to build your program. To delete a block, drag it to the trash in the corner."
      10:
        image: "notes/hoc1_10.jpg"
        text: 'Each block is one instruction. If you drag a "move forward" block to your workspace and press "Run Program", the bird moves one space on the maze.'
      11:
        image: "notes/hoc1_11.jpg"
        text: "To do more than one action, you can drag many block to your workspace and attach them together. The bird will do the commands from top to bottom."

        image: "notes/stage5_2.jpg"
        text: "In these puzzles, you'll be an artist that draws a line behind them everywhere they go."
      3:
        image: "notes/stage5_3.jpg"
        text: 'This block says "move forward by 100 pixels." Pixels are just really tiny dots on your screen.'
      4:
        image: "notes/stage5_4.jpg"
        text: 'This block says "turn right by 90 degrees." This will turn your artist the same amount as the "turn" blocks in the maze puzzles.'
      5:
        image: "notes/stage5_5.jpg"
        text: "Click on the arrow in either of these blocks to change the amount the artist moves forward or turns. Play around to get familiar with these new blocks."
    farmer_intro:
      1:
        image: "notes/stage9_1.jpg"
        text: "Hi, I'm Paola! In these puzzles, you're a farmer who has to get her field completely flat to start planting crops."
      2:
        image: "notes/stage9_2.jpg"
        text: "You have to help her remove all the piles of dirt and fill in all the holes."
      3:
        image: "notes/stage9_3.jpg"
        text: "The new blocks remove 1 shovelful of dirt from a pile and fill in 1 shovelful of dirt to a hole."
      4:
        image: "notes/stage9_4.jpg"
        text: "The piles and holes are different sizes, so you have to tell the farmer how many shovelfuls to use."
    loop_times:
      1:
        image: "notes/hoc2_1.jpg"
        text: "Hi, I'm Mark! Let's learn about loops. Using loops you can tell a computer to repeat any set of actions over and over, thousands or even billions of times."
      2:
        image: "notes/hoc2_2.jpg"
        text: "In this puzzle, we want to make the bird move forward 5 spaces to get to the pig."
      3:
        image: "notes/hoc2_3.jpg"
        text: 'We can use the new "repeat" block to help us out.'
      4:

        text: 'Instead of dragging out 5 "move forward" blocks...'
      5:
        image: "notes/hoc2_5.jpg"
        text: 'We can put the "move forward" block inside the "repeat" block and write a number in the block to tell it how many times to repeat.'

    loop_until:
      1:
        image: "notes/hoc3_1.jpg"
        text: |-
          Hi, I'm Chris. Before joining the Miami Heat, I went to Georgia Tech to study Computer Science. Let's try our new block, the "repeat until" block.
      2:
        image: "notes/hoc3_2.jpg"
        text: "What if we didn't know how far the bird had to move to get to the pig?"
      3:
        image: "notes/hoc3_3.jpg"
        text: 'If we put a "move forward" block inside the "repeat until" block, the bird will move forward UNTIL it reaches the pig (or crashes into a wall).'
      4:
        image: "notes/hoc3_4.jpg"
        text: 'And this is important: just like before, we can put multiple blocks inside the "repeat until" block, and they will all be repeated.'
    if:

        text: |-
          Hi, I'm Bill! Let's learn a new fundamental concept: "If" statements. This is how computers make decisions.
      2:
        image: "notes/hoc4_2.jpg"
        text: |-
          You use "If" statements yourself everday. Before you go outside each morning, you say IF it's raining outside, I need to wear my jacket.
      3:
        image: "notes/hoc4_3.jpg"
        text: "We can tell the zombie to check IF there's path to the left, and if he finds a path to the left, we can have him turn in that direction."
      4:
        image: "notes/hoc4_4.jpg"
        text: |-
          To write the code for this, let's drag out our "if" block and put a "turn left" block inside it.
      5:
        image: "notes/hoc4_5.jpg"
        text: |-
          Now, if we put a "move forward" block above it and a "repeat" block around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a path to the left and turn. The "repeat" command is critical, to check for a turn at every step.
      6:
        image: "notes/hoc4_6.jpg"
        text: "If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first programs I wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them win."
      7:
        image: "notes/hoc4_7.jpg"
        text: 'Have fun using the "if" block!'
    if_else:

        image: "notes/hoc5_1.jpg"
        text: |-
          Hi, my name is Saloni. I use computer science to help solve problems in health and medicine. Let's learn about the "if else" block. It looks like the "if" block, but it has an extra part at the end that says "else".
      2:
        image: "notes/hoc5_2.jpg"
        text: |-
          If I put a "move forward" block in the spot where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else" that means that the zombie will choose between 2 options. IF there is a path ahead, the zombie will move forward, and OTHERWISE (there isn't a path ahead), the zombie will turn left.
      3:
        image: "notes/hoc5_3.jpg"
        text: |-
          Just like the "if" block, we can put "if else" blocks inside a "repeat" blocks so that the zombie keeps moving and the "if else" block will keep checking if there's somewhere to turn.

        text: "Now, get those zombies where they belong!"
    function:
      1:
        image: "notes/stage13_1.jpg"
        text: "Hi, I'm Brina, an engineer at Instagram. A function is certain lines of code that you want to use over and over again, so instead of writing that code out everytime, you can just use one block."
      2:
        image: "notes/stage13_2.jpg"
        text: "We're going to learn how to define functions. Function definitions have a star in the corner. The name of the function is written on the top line."
      3:
        image: "notes/stage13_3.jpg"
        text: |-
          The blocks that go inside the definition tell us what it does. So this function definition is called "fill 5" and it's made up of a "repeat" block and a "fill" block.
      4:
        image: "notes/stage13_4.jpg"
        text: |-
          The definition sits on the workspace, but our farmer won't run the function until we drag out our "fill 5" function block from functions category.
      5:
        image: "notes/stage13_5.jpg"
        text: |-
          Let's put the "fun" back in "FUNction!" 
    loop_while:
      1:
        image: "notes/stage9_5.jpg"
        text: |-
          Hi, I'm Makinde! Let's learn about the "while block." 
      2:
        image: "notes/stage9_6.jpg"
        text: 'The "while block" will do whatever you put inside it AS LONG AS the statement on the top is TRUE.'
      3:
        image: "notes/stage9_7.jpg"
        text: "For example, if the farmer is standing on a pile, she will continue to remove 1 shovelful WHILE there is still a pile beneath her."
    loop_for:

        text: "Hi, I'm Trina, and I work for Pixar. I've worked on a bunch of movies, including Shrek."
      2:
        image: "notes/stage11_2.jpg"
        text: 'This is our new "counter" loop. It will perform actions over and over again and you can make the actions change slightly each time.'
      3:
        image: "notes/stage11_3.jpg"
        text: 'In this example, our "counter" loop says "count with counter from 50 to 90 by 10" and inside it, we have our "draw a square" block. Drag the "counter" block from the "Variables" section into the "length" spot.'
      4:
        image: "notes/stage11_4.jpg"
        text: "This means our artist is going to draw a square that has 50 pixel length sides, then it will add 10 to that and draw a square with 60 pixel length sides. Then it will keep adding 10 and drawing squares until it reaches 90. So we'll have squares of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90."
    parameters:

        text: "Hi, I'm Janete, and I'm an engineer at Zynga."
      2:
        image: "notes/stage15_2.jpg"
        text: "What if we want to draw a bunch of triangles and have their lengths be different sizes?"
      3:
        image: "notes/stage15_3.jpg"
        text: "We could write all that code out by hand or we can use a function with parameters."
      4:
        image: "notes/stage15_4.jpg"
        text: 'To do this, click the blue star on the "draw a triangle" function definition. Then drag "input name" into the "input" block.'
      5:
        image: "notes/stage15_5.jpg"
        text: |-
          Then if you write "length" in the spot where it says "x" and press "Enter" you'll create a length input for your function.
      6:
        image: "notes/stage15_6.jpg"
        text: 'Then click on the star. Now, you want to click on the variables category and drag the "length" block into the "move forward" block of your function definition. And drag away the old number block.'
      7:
        image: "notes/stage15_7.jpg"
        text: 'To use your function with parameters, click on the functions category and drag out your "draw a triangle with length" function.'
      8:
        image: "notes/stage15_8.jpg"
        text: "Now you can use the math block to input different numbers to draw triangles of different sizes."

        text: "Congratulations! With the last puzzle you solved, you just wrote code that can tell ANY robot how to find it's way through a non-branching maze or tunnel of any length, whether it's a zombie, a bird, a mars rover, or even a self-driving car."
      2:
        image: "notes/hoc6_2.jpg"
        text: "The basic concepts you used are at the heart of every program or app you'll ever try.  We learned about repeat loops, repeat until statements, if statements, and if else statements."

        turtle_1_2: 'Now, draw a square. NOTE: use your favorite color by picking it in the new "set color" block.'
        turtle_1_3: "Make a square using only 3 blocks."
        turtle_1_4: |-
          Draw a triangle whose sides are all in different colors, using the "random color" option that picks a different color each time. Hint: you'll have to figure out how far to turn by clicking on the number in the turn block.
        turtle_1_5: "Now, for practice, draw a triangle and then a square to draw an envelope."
        turtle_1_6: "Can you figure out how draw this triangle and square? Hint: Do the triangle first, then figure out how much to turn before drawing the square."
        turtle_1_7: "Ok, let's make it a bit harder - see if you can draw these green glasses. The squares are 100 pixels on each side, and they're 50 pixels apart. Don't forget to draw in green!"
        turtle_1_8: 'Ok, try to figure out what happens if you run this code (or press "Run" to try it). Then, repeat it enough times to complete the drawing. The colors will be different every time.'
        turtle_1_9: "Can you figure out what number to replace the question marks with to draw a circle?"
        turtle_1_10: 'You made it! Now, draw anything you want. Some fun ideas: a stick figure, snowflake, or spiral. Also try the new "set width" block. Have fun!'
        turtle_4_1: 'Can you draw a triangle (with edges of 100 pixels) with only 3 blocks? Hint: use a "repeat" block.'
        turtle_4_2: |-
          Try adding one block to complete this puzzle. Hint: we've provided blocks to draw 2 identical triangles, you need to put a "turn" in between, and decide out how far to turn.
        turtle_4_3: |-
          Ok, here's the code you wrote to draw a single triangle. Can you add a "repeat" and "turn" block to make a pretty flower?
        turtle_4_4: "Here's the same code from the previous puzzle, but turning only 36 degrees after drawing each triangle. How many times does this need to repeat? (Hint: after 360 degrees of turning the drawing will come full circle)"
        turtle_4_5: "Here's the same code from the previous puzzle, but repeating the turns 36 times. How many degrees should the turns be? (Hint: after 360 degrees of turning the drawing will come full circle)"
        turtle_4_6: "Using only 3 blocks, can you draw a square with edges of 20 pixels?"
        turtle_4_7: "Here's the code for drawing the square from last puzzle. Can you repeat it to draw 10 adjacent squares like a ladder? Hint: you only need 2 more blocks."
        turtle_4_8: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. Can you add just 2 more blocks to complete the drawing?"
        turtle_4_9: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. How many degrees should you turn to complete the drawing? (You probably need to guess a few times)"
        turtle_4_10: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. How many times should you repeat to complete the drawing?"

          Hi, I'm a farmer. I need your help to flatten the field on my farm so it's ready for planting. Move me to the pile of dirt and use the "remove" block to remove it.
        maze_karel_1_2: 'Next, move me to the hole and fill it with TWO shovelfuls of dirt, using the "fill" block.'
        maze_karel_1_3: "Move me to the pile of dirt and tell me how many shovelfuls to remove using as few blocks as possible."
        maze_karel_1_4: "Can you help me remove all four piles of dirt? Hint: use a repeat block if you can."
        maze_karel_1_5: 'Help me fill in all these holes with 5 shovelfuls of dirt. Hint: you can put a "repeat" block inside the "while" block.'
        maze_karel_1_6: |-
          Remove all the piles of dirt, using as few blocks as possible. The new options in the dropdown menu on the "while" block tell me if I'm standing on a pile or a hole.
        maze_karel_1_7: "Wow, I found a really deep hole! I don't know how many shovelfuls of dirt it needs. Can you write a program that fills it until the ground is even?"
        maze_karel_1_8: "Help me fill in the hole at the end of the field, using as few blocks as possible."
        maze_karel_1_9: 'Make me remove all these piles of dirt. Try to use as few blocks as possible. Hint: try using a "while" block.'
        maze_karel_1_10: "I'm working late, so it's dark out, and I can't tell how large the piles are. Now I don't have all the options I used to have on the while block. Move me along the field, and if there is a pile, remove it."
        maze_karel_1_11: |-
          It's still dark outside. Move me along the field. If there is a pile, remove it, and if there is a hole, fill it in. Hint: use the dropdown menu of options on the "if" block.
        turtle_2_1: "Hello. Me zombie artist. Me love drawing! Help me draw a square in a special color. Important note: you have all the same blocks but they've now been arranged in categories."
        turtle_2_2: 'Welcome to using functions, which let you define new blocks! Try the new "draw a square" block, found in the "Functions" category, to draw a small 50x50 green square.'
        turtle_2_3: 'Use the "repeat" block (in the "Loops" category) to draw 3 squares of size 100, each 120 degrees apart. And do it in 3 different, random colors.'
        turtle_2_4: "Now we're going to get fancy. Change the code to draw 36 squares, 100 pixels wide, and each 10 degrees apart. Hint: you may want to use the slider to make me go faster."
        turtle_2_5: |-
          Draw squares with sides of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 pixels.  You'll need to use the "draw a square" function five times.
        turtle_2_6: |-
          Ok, this program will use a counter, to draw the same squares as last time. You want the square to be the same size as the counter, so use the "counter" block. Hint: It's in the Variables category.
        turtle_2_7: |-
          Here's a program to draw a spiral, but the blocks are disabled so they won't run. Make a new program using a "count with" block (in the Loops category) and "counter" block (in the Variables category) to draw the same spiral.
        turtle_2_7_5: |-
          There's a new "draw a snowman" function (in the Functions category). Draw two snowmen, of height 250 and 100.
        turtle_2_8: |-
          This one's a bit tricky. Use the "draw a snowman" function and the new "jump forward" block (in the Actions category). Draw 3 snowmen in different colors, 100 pixels apart.
        turtle_2_9: 'Use a "count with" loop to draw a family of snowmen with heights of 110, 100, 90, 80, and 70. The snowmen should all be 60 pixels apart.'
        turtle_2_10: "Here's some code to try experimenting with different spirals.  What happens if you change the turn amount? Or set a random color in the loop?  Draw anything you like."
        maze_karel_2_1: "Try using the blocks to help me remove all the piles and fill in all the holes on the ground. Try to use loops instead of using too many blocks. Hint: you can put a loop inside another loop."
        maze_karel_2_2: |-
          We've defined our own block called "fill 5", which is now in the Functions category. Use it to help me fill in this hole.
        maze_karel_2_3: |-
          Use the new "fill 5" function block to make me fill in all the holes. You'll have to drag out the "fill 5" block out from the Functions category.
        maze_karel_2_4: "Define a new function that removes 7 shovelfuls. Then use it to write a program that helps me remove all the piles."
        maze_karel_2_5: "Create a new function that removes 6 shovelfuls from a pile, and use it to help me level out all the piles."
        maze_karel_2_6: 'Use two new functions, "fill 8" and "remove 8", to help me level out the pile and fill in the hole.'
        maze_karel_2_7: "There's a cow in my field! Write a new function that helps me avoid the cow and remove the pile. Put all your blocks inside the new function."
        maze_karel_2_8: 'Use this new function, "avoid the cow and remove 1", to help me remove all the piles.'
        maze_karel_2_9: "Ok, here's a function that removes 4 different piles of dirt in a vertical column. Try putting this function inside a loop, so that you remove all the piles of dirt using only a few new blocks."
        maze_karel_2_10: "Move me across the field, and use these two functions to help me remove all the piles and fill all the holes."
        turtle_3_1: |-
          This puzzle shows you how the "draw a square" and "draw a circle" functions are defined.  Defining a function doesn't run its blocks.  You have to pull out the "draw a square" block to actually draw a square.
        turtle_3_2: 'Using the "draw a square" function as an example, create a "draw a triangle" function and use it.'
        turtle_3_3: "Draw triangular fences around the cats and a square fence around the cow.  Tip: test the program as you go along."
        turtle_3_4: 'See if you can figure out how to use "draw a square" and "draw a triangle" (and some other blocks) to draw a house around the lion.'
        turtle_3_5: 'Now create a new "draw a house" function and use it to house two cats. Hint: create a new function using the "do something" block, and type your own text to name the block.'
        turtle_3_6: 'Using "draw a square" as an example, add an input named "length" to "draw a triangle". Then, draw triangles in different sizes. (Hint: click the star to add an input to a function)'
        turtle_3_7: 'Add an input named "length" to "draw a house" and build a big house for the elephant (with edges 150 pixels long)'
        turtle_3_8: 'Here are all of the blocks from the previous puzzle.  Modify "draw a house" so I end up at the bottom right corner after drawing a new house. Use this modified function to draw three houses.'
        turtle_3_9: 'Can you re-create the "draw a house" function without help? Try it, and then draw a row of houses.'
        turtle_3_10: "You've learned a lot! Now use it to draw whatever you want. Try to draw a star, or a spiral, or a fancy snowflake."
        maze_karel_debug_seq_1: "Welcome to debugging! My code doesn't work right. Can you spot the problem and fix it so that I can get my field flat and ready for planting?"
        maze_karel_debug_seq_2: "What's wrong with this program? How should you fix it so I can remove that pile?"
        maze_karel_debug_repeat: "De-bug this program for me so my field will be nice and flat."

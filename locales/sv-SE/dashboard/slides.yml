        text: "We'll be using Blockly, a visual programming language where you drag and drop blocks to write code."

        text: "Most programs are written with text, and under the hood of the blocks you'll be using is text as well."

        text: In Blocky, the left side is the maze where your program will run. The instructions for each puzzle are written below the maze.

        text: "The middle is the toolbox which has the commands that the bird understands. You'll use these blocks to build your code."

        image: notes/hoc1_9.png
        text: "On the right is your workspace where you'll drag and drop blocks from the toolbox to build your program. And the trash is in the upper right-hand corner if you ever want to delete a block."
      10:
        image: notes/hoc1_10.png
        text: Each block is one instruction. If you drag a "move forward" block out to your workspace and press "Run Program", the bird moves forward one space on the maze.
      11:
        image: notes/hoc1_11.png
        text: If you want your bird to do more than one action, drag out another block to your workspace and wait until the orange arrow appears. When you press the "Run Program" button, the bird will do the commands on the workspace from top to bottom. The command that the bird is currently doing on the maze will be highlighted on the workspace.

        text: In this puzzle, we want to make the bird move forward 5 spaces to get to the pig.

        text: And we can use the new "repeat times" block which is called a loop to help us out.

        text: Instead of dragging out 5 "move forward" blocks...
      5:
        image: notes/hoc2_5.png
        text: We can put the "move forward" block inside the "repeat times" block and write a number in the block to tell it how many times to repeat.
      6:
        image: notes/hoc2_6.png
        text: And you can put more than one command inside a "repeat times" block.

          Hi, I'm Sara. Let's try out our new block called the "repeat until" block.

        text: "You use If statments in your everday life. For example, before you go outside in the morning, you say IF it's raining outside, I need to wear my jacket."

        text: "So we can tell the zombie to check IF there's path to the left and if he finds a path to the left, we can have him turn in that direction."
      4:
        image: notes/hoc4_4.png
        text: |-
          To write the code for this, let's drag out our "if" block and put a "turn left" block inside of it.
      5:
        image: notes/hoc4_5.png
        text: |-
          Now, if we put a "move forward" block above it and a "repeat" block around everything, this will tell the zombie to repeatedly move forward and everytime he moves forward, he'll check if there's a path to the left. Then when he finds a path to the left, he'll turn left and continue moving forward.

        text: If statements are really important in computer science. One of the first programs I ever wrote was a tic-tac-toe game, and there was a If statement that said IF the other person is about to win, block the spot that lets them win.

          Hi, my name is Saloni, and I study computer science and how it applies to health. Let's learn about the "if else" block. It looks like the "if" block, but it has an extra part at the end that says "else".
      2:
        image: notes/hoc5_2.png
        text: |-
          If I put a "move forward" block in the spot where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else" that means that the zombie will choose between 2 options. If there is a path ahead, the zombie will move forward, and if there isn't a path ahead, the zombie will turn left.
      3:
        image: notes/hoc5_3.png
        text: |-
          Just like the "if" block, we can "if else" blocks inside a "repeat" blocks so that the zombie keeps moving forward on the path and the "if else" block will keep checking if there's somewhere to turn.

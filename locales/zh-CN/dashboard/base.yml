      Click the link below to sign up for computer science tutorials on Code.org (with me as your "teacher"):
      
      %{link}
      
      The tutorials are fun, visually engaging, and teach the basic concepts of computer science using a simple, guided, game-like experience. Learn to code from Bill Gates, Mark Zuckerberg, Angry Birds, and Plants vs. Zombies! :-)

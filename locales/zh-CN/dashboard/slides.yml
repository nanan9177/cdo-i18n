          You use "If" statements yourself everday. Before you go outside each morning, you say IF it's raining outside, I need to wear my jacket.

        image: "notes/hoc4_4.png"
        text: |-
          To write the code for this, let's drag out our "if" block and put a "turn left" block inside it.
      5:

        text: |-
          Now, if we put a "move forward" block above it and a "repeat" block around everything, each time the zombie moves, he'll check if there's a path to the left and turn. The "repeat" command is critical, to check for a turn at every step.

          Hi, my name is Saloni. I use computer science to help solve problems in health and medicine. Let's learn about the "if else" block. It looks like the "if" block, but it has an extra part at the end that says "else".
      2:
        image: "notes/hoc5_2.png"
        text: |-
          If I put a "move forward" block in the spot where it says "do" and a "turn left" block where it says "else" that means that the zombie will choose between 2 options. IF there is a path ahead, the zombie will move forward, and OTHERWISE (there isn't a path ahead), the zombie will turn left.
      3:
        image: "notes/hoc5_3.png"
        text: |-
          Just like the "if" block, we can put "if else" blocks inside a "repeat" blocks so that the zombie keeps moving and the "if else" block will keep checking if there's somewhere to turn.

        maze_2_12: "好，這個類似，但略有不同。你可以在只有 5 塊完成它嗎？"
        maze_2_13: '使用新的"如果"塊讓我來決定何時轉彎。提示： 您只需要多一個塊，但學習我們如何設置它所以下一次你可以自己完成。'
        maze_2_14: '好，這就像是最後一個謎題，但您需要記住您如何將"如果"塊和"重複"塊一起使用。'
        maze_2_15: '我想要向日葵 ！使用"if"塊，讓我到那使用最少數目的塊。'
        maze_2_16: "好，讓我們不要再次練習--這不是非常不同，但注意食殭花 ！"
        maze_2_17: '這"假如-其它"塊檢查一個條件，然後做這一件事情或另一個。讓我在拿到向日葵時嘗試使用此新的塊。'
        maze_2_18: '再一次練習"假如-其它"塊，你能在你第一次嘗試就拿到它嗎?'
        maze_2_19: "您可以只添加 3 塊來幫我解決一個更加複雜的迷宮嗎？如果你做對了，不管任何彎曲路徑的長度我都可以走。"

        turtle_1_5: "現在，為了練習，繪製一個三角形然後一個正方形來繪製一個信封。"
        turtle_1_6: "你能想出如何畫此三角形和正方形嗎？提示： 首先畫三角形，然後想出轉動多少來畫正方形。"
        turtle_1_7: "好，讓我們增加點困難度-看看是否您可以繪製這些綠色的眼鏡。正方形是每側 100 個畫素，而他們之間相距 50 畫素）。不要忘記是用綠色繪製 ！"
        turtle_1_8: '好, 嘗試了解如果您運行此程式 （或試著按下"執行"） 會發生什麼。然後，重複它足夠多的次數來完成繪圖。每次顏色都會不同。'
        turtle_1_9: "你能想出該用什麼號碼取代問號用來繪製一個圓嗎？"
        turtle_1_10: '你成功了 ！現在，繪製任何你想要畫的。一些有趣的想法： 棒圖、 雪花、 或螺旋。也嘗試新的"設置寬度"塊。玩得愉快！'
        turtle_4_1: '你可以畫一個只使用 3 個塊的三角形 （100 畫素的邊）？提示： 使用"重複"塊。'
        turtle_4_2: '嘗試加一個塊來完成這個謎題。提示： 我們提供塊來繪製 2 個相同的三角形，你需要放"轉向"在這之間，並決定多遠轉向。'
        turtle_4_3: '好，這裡是你寫的繪製一個單一的三角形的程式。你可以添加一個"重複"和"轉向"的塊來做出一朵漂亮的花嗎？'
        turtle_4_4: "Here's the same code from the previous puzzle, but turning only 36 degrees after drawing each triangle. How many times does this need to repeat? (Hint: after 360 degrees of turning the drawing will come full circle)"

        turtle_4_6: "Using only 3 blocks, can you draw a square with edges of 20 pixels?"
        turtle_4_7: "Here's the code for drawing the square from last puzzle. Can you repeat it to draw 10 adjacent squares like a ladder? Hint: you only need 2 more blocks."
        turtle_4_8: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. Can you add just 2 more blocks to complete the drawing?"
        turtle_4_9: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. How many degrees should you turn to complete the drawing? (You probably need to guess a few times)"
        turtle_4_10: "Here's the solution to the previous puzzle. How many times should you repeat to complete the drawing?"
        turtle_4_11: 'Try changing the numbers in the "turn" and "repeat" blocks to make different patterns. Or, experiment changing the rest of the code to draw anything you want.'

          Hi, I'm a farmer. I need your help to flatten the field on my farm so it's ready for planting. Move me to the pile of dirt and use the "remove" block to remove it.
        maze_karel_1_2: 'Next, move me to the hole and fill it with TWO shovelfuls of dirt, using the "fill" block.'
        maze_karel_1_3: "Move me to the pile of dirt and tell me how many shovelfuls to remove using as few blocks as possible."
        maze_karel_1_4: "Can you help me remove all four piles of dirt? Hint: use a repeat block if you can."
        maze_karel_1_5: 'Help me fill in all these holes with 5 shovelfuls of dirt. Hint: you can put a "repeat" block inside the "while" block.'
        maze_karel_1_6: |-
          Remove all the piles of dirt, using as few blocks as possible. The new options in the dropdown menu on the "while" block tell me if I'm standing on a pile or a hole.
        maze_karel_1_7: "Wow, I found a really deep hole! I don't know how many shovelfuls of dirt it needs. Can you write a program that fills it until the ground is even?"
        maze_karel_1_8: "Help me fill in the hole at the end of the field, using as few blocks as possible."
        maze_karel_1_9: 'Make me remove all these piles of dirt. Try to use as few blocks as possible. Hint: try using a "while" block.'
        maze_karel_1_10: "I'm working late, so it's dark out, and I can't tell how large the piles are. Now I don't have all the options I used to have on the while block. Move me along the field, and if there is a pile, remove it."
        maze_karel_1_11: |-
          It's still dark outside. Move me along the field. If there is a pile, remove it, and if there is a hole, fill it in. Hint: use the dropdown menu of options on the "if" block.
        turtle_2_1: "Hello. Me zombie artist. Me love drawing! Help me draw a square in a special color. Important note: you have all the same blocks but they've now been arranged in categories."
        turtle_2_2: 'Welcome to using functions, which let you define new blocks! Try the new "draw a square" block, found in the "Functions" category, to draw a small 50x50 green square.'
        turtle_2_3: 'Use the "repeat" block (in the "Loops" category) to draw 3 squares of size 100, each 120 degrees apart. And do it in 3 different, random colors.'
        turtle_2_4: "Now we're going to get fancy. Change the code to draw 36 squares, 100 pixels wide, and each 10 degrees apart. Hint: you may want to use the slider to make me go faster."
        turtle_2_5: |-
          Draw squares with sides of 50, 60, 70, 80, and 90 pixels.  You'll need to use the "draw a square" function five times.
        turtle_2_6: |-
          Ok, this program will use a counter, to draw the same squares as last time. You want the square to be the same size as the counter, so use the "counter" block. Hint: It's in the Variables category.
        turtle_2_7: |-
          Here's a program to draw a spiral, but the blocks are disabled so they won't run. Make a new program using a "count with" block (in the Loops category) and "counter" block (in the Variables category) to draw the same spiral.
        turtle_2_7_5: |-
          There's a new "draw a snowman" function (in the Functions category). Draw two snowmen, of height 250 and 100.
        turtle_2_8: |-
          This one's a bit tricky. Use the "draw a snowman" function and the new "jump forward" block (in the Actions category). Draw 3 snowmen in different colors, 100 pixels apart.
        turtle_2_9: 'Use a "count with" loop to draw a family of snowmen with heights of 110, 100, 90, 80, and 70. The snowmen should all be 60 pixels apart.'
        turtle_2_10: "Here's some code to try experimenting with different spirals.  What happens if you change the turn amount? Or set a random color in the loop?  Draw anything you like."
        maze_karel_2_1: "Try using the blocks to help me remove all the piles and fill in all the holes on the ground. Try to use loops instead of using too many blocks. Hint: you can put a loop inside another loop."
        maze_karel_2_2: |-
          We've defined our own block called "fill 5", which is now in the Functions category. Use it to help me fill in this hole.
        maze_karel_2_3: |-
          Use the new "fill 5" function block to make me fill in all the holes. You'll have to drag out the "fill 5" block out from the Functions category.
        maze_karel_2_4: "Define a new function that removes 7 shovelfuls. Then use it to write a program that helps me remove all the piles."
        maze_karel_2_5: "Create a new function that removes 6 shovelfuls from a pile, and use it to help me level out all the piles."
        maze_karel_2_6: 'Use two new functions, "fill 8" and "remove 8", to help me level out the pile and fill in the hole.'
        maze_karel_2_7: "There's a cow in my field! Write a new function that helps me avoid the cow and remove the pile. Put all your blocks inside the new function."
        maze_karel_2_8: 'Use this new function, "avoid the cow and remove 1", to help me remove all the piles.'
        maze_karel_2_9: "Ok, here's a function that removes 4 different piles of dirt in a vertical column. Try putting this function inside a loop, so that you remove all the piles of dirt using only a few new blocks."
        maze_karel_2_10: "Move me across the field, and use these two functions to help me remove all the piles and fill all the holes."
        turtle_3_1: |-
          This puzzle shows you how the "draw a square" and "draw a circle" functions are defined.  Defining a function doesn't run its blocks.  You have to pull out the "draw a square" block to actually draw a square.
        turtle_3_2: 'Using the "draw a square" function as an example, create a "draw a triangle" function and use it.'
        turtle_3_3: "Draw triangular fences around the cats and a square fence around the cow.  Tip: test the program as you go along."
        turtle_3_4: 'See if you can figure out how to use "draw a square" and "draw a triangle" (and some other blocks) to draw a house around the lion.'
        turtle_3_5: 'Now create a new "draw a house" function and use it to house two cats. Hint: create a new function using the "do something" block, and type your own text to name the block.'
        turtle_3_6: 'Using "draw a square" as an example, add an input named "length" to "draw a triangle". Then, draw triangles in different sizes. (Hint: click the star to add an input to a function)'
        turtle_3_7: 'Add an input named "length" to "draw a house" and build a big house for the elephant (with edges 150 pixels long)'
        turtle_3_8: 'Here are all of the blocks from the previous puzzle.  Modify "draw a house" so I end up at the bottom right corner after drawing a new house. Use this modified function to draw three houses.'
        turtle_3_9: 'Can you re-create the "draw a house" function without help? Try it, and then draw a row of houses.'
        turtle_3_10: "你學到了很多 ！現在用它來繪製任何你想畫的東西。嘗試畫一顆星，一個螺旋或花俏的雪花。"
        maze_karel_debug_seq_1: "歡迎來除錯 ！我的程式不能正常運行。你可以發現問題並修復它，這樣我的田地會是平坦的並能即刻種植作物嗎？"
        maze_karel_debug_seq_2: "What's wrong with this program? How should you fix it so I can remove that pile?"
        maze_karel_debug_repeat: "De-bug this program for me so my field will be nice and flat."
        maze_karel_debug_while: "你應該如何改變這個程式來協助我補這個缺口？"
        maze_karel_debug_if: "幫我! 修正這個程式所以我的田地將完全是平坦的。"
        maze_karel_debug_if_else: "De-bug this program so I can fill in the holes and remove all the piles."
        maze_karel_debug_function_1: "What should you change about this program to help me remove all the piles?"
        maze_karel_debug_function_2: "Can you de-bug this program for me so I can make my field flat?"
        maze_karel_debug_function_3: "Edit this program so I'll remove all the piles on my field. "

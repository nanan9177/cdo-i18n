        desc: "This lesson will introduce the concept of Computer Science and explain what a Computer Scientist does.  It will also give students an opportunity to assume the role of a computer scientist.  By the end of the activity, each student will have a take-home reminder of what he or she learned.  You may be tempted to skip teaching young children the vocabulary words that are associated with the lessons that follow, but presenting them in a fun and playful light now is far more productive than waiting for more advanced opportunities."

        desc: "With nothing but paper and markers, students will learn the four steps of computational thinking. After a brief introduction, students should be split into groups where they will have to create directions for other students to draw a specific monster (from a catalog of pre-selected monsters). The entire task must be decomposed, then teams will analyze all monsters in the catalog for patterns, abstract different details from the monsters, then use that information to create an algorithm (directions) for another team to draw a certain monster. Teams will then switch algorithms with another group and draw the monster based on what that algorithm indicates. Is the drawing what the original team intended?"

        desc: "By programming one another to draw pictures, students will begin to understand what programming is really about. The class will begin by students instructing each other to color squares in on graph paper in an effort to reproduce an existing picture.  If there's time, the lesson can conclude with images that the students create themselves."

Afterward, the class will explore how many ways you can fold paper into a rectangle, noting how some methods can take more or fewer folds than others."

          In this lesson, students will make a suncatcher out of string, beads, and a special charm. The students will follow a series of repetitive steps, then be asked to identify certain sets of "skills" that are duplicated several times. Once those skills are defined, they will be called from a main program and the whole beautiful process of creation will be recorded on a single sheet of paper. The final program will be geared toward the entire class, whatever their type of string, beads, and charms. To effectively allow for this, students will need to "abstract out" the details of their specific materials and create vague terms for an individual's supplies.  This use of generic placeholders is a wonderful introduction to variables.

We'll take an activity that's already common knowledge and shift it into a solid education on defining and calling functions. Once students are familiar with the define/call process, we will add the extra capabilities that come along with passing parameters within those function calls."
